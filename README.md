## Goals for Week 2

In the second week, you will:

- Learn to use the `static` keyword for implementing the singleton pattern.
- Understand and correctly apply the `final` keyword to make variables, methods, or classes immutable or unchangeable.
- Master the usage of enumerations to represent predefined sets of named constants.
- Become adept at working with nested collections, including lists of lists or maps of lists.
- Write generic code, which involves implementing your own Stack data structure.
- Create functions and functional interfaces using lambda expressions.
- Read and write lambdas, comprehending their anonymous function nature and their influence on code readability.
- Utilize the Java 8 streaming API for operations like map, reduce, and collect, all while using lambdas.
- Grasp the concept of closures in Java, enabling lambdas to access variables from their enclosing scope.
- Develop a comprehensive understanding of types as abstractions that define object behavior.
- Effectively work with Optionals to handle null values and ensure robust code.
